    <h3>A Simple, lightweight framework for Roblox</h2>
</div>

### About

Nebula is a lightweight integrated framework to allow the smooth operation of a game on the Roblox platform while handling all of the often nitty gritty and tedious tasks involved in setting up a reliable structure in which to start writing your game.

Nebula aims to provide developers with a simple core structure of which they can then add, remove or create new modules that can be plugged into the framework to allow further, more complex functionality or a simpler, streamlined system.

*\* This project is incomplete.*

### Structure

Nebula uses an integrated structure *AKA Single Script Architecture*. This means there is only 1 script on both the server and client which will run and initialise the environment. From there, the network module (a core dependency) will initialise, and start communicating with each other through internal channels. The developer can create different shared resources, server services and client controllers which can be plugged into the environment using the specified folder directories and applying the necessary formats.

More will be said on this once the project has been released, along with a detailed documentation outlining everything one could possibly want to know about this framework.
